          <h2>MY REVIEW</h2>
          <p>
           Reading It Ends with Us was an emotional experience for me. I didn’t expect it to be so deep and serious, but it really opened my eyes to what people go through in unhealthy relationships. I liked how the story wasn’t just about romance,it showed the struggle of making the right choice, even when it’s painful. I felt connected to Lily and admired her strength. Some parts were hard to read, but that’s what made it powerful. It made me think a lot about love, pain, and self-worth, and I appreciate how real the story felt
