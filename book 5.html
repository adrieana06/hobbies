            Logan, a student at elite Draycott Academy, is haunted by the death of Sophie, a girl he was obsessed with but never truly dated. His grief is all-consuming, and he struggles to rejoin school life, feeling like a ghost among the living. Meanwhile, Delilah Wong, a new student, arrives at Draycott, carrying her own burdens: her father's death, her mother's abusive boyfriend Brandon, and the weight of being an outsider. Both teens are marked by trauma and loss, setting the stage for their fateful collision.

          <h2>MY REVIEW</h2>
          <p>
           The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was truly one of the most compelling novels I've ever read. The amount of thought behind every chapter was beyond anything I'd seen before. The author did an impeccable job at showing the reader all aspects of Evelyn Hugo and taking us decade by decade throughout her life whilst making it all connect perfectly. When it comes to historical fiction, I have never read something this captivating and honest before as this book. Evelyn is a real mystery, and even after 400 pages simply dedicated to her, you're left with so many questions.
