            A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder by Holly Jackson is a fun, fresh read for someone of any age (above 13) who enjoys crime, murder mystery or thrillers, even if they don’t read them regularly.Good-girl, high school senior Pip is applying to top-tier colleges and hanging out with her close friends and lovely family when she decides that her senior project will be an investigation into the five-year-old murder of the town sweetheart, Andie, by her boyfriend, Sal, who then killed himself. Something about the whole thing didn’t seem right to Pip, and certainly the racism that it engendered about Sal and his still-present family wasn’t right. But as Pip digs deeper and deeper, ignoring the warnings of her teacher and the concerns of her friends and family, Pip discovers that the town secrets merely begin with the murder-suicide.

          <h2>MY REVIEW</h2>
          <p>
           I absolutely love it! Never read a more interesting book in my life! I am simply obsessed with this whole trilogy! The plot twists were fascinating. The characters just drew me in. I can't put the book down. So unpredictable, and so...attracting! My favorite mystery ever! If there's one book I can sell my soul to read for the first time, its A Good Girl's Guide To Murder!
Holly Jackson's writing just attracts you so much that I bet you won't be able to put it down. Mystery, thrill, humor, and realism in the book is exactly what sticks you to the book. From mystery to emotions, this book is a whirlpool where you would lose yourself!
