          <h2>MY REVIEW</h2>
          <p>
           “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” is one of the most interesting books I’ve ever read. Each chapter was clearly written with a lot of thought, and the story was put together really well. The author did a great job showing all sides of Evelyn Hugo and took us through each part of her life in a way that made everything fit together perfectly. I’ve never read a historical fiction book that felt so honest and exciting. Evelyn is such a mysterious character, and even after 400 pages about her, you’re still left with many questions.
